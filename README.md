# Smart Contract Station\n\n## Overview\n*Smart Contract Station* is a Python tool that manages and deploys smart contracts onto the Ethereum blockchain in an automated manner. This tool extracted rich data from the contracts, including source code and metadata, to determine the launch order and to identify any dependencies required for the contracts to function correctly. \n\n## Table of Contents\n1.

It provides visibility into a contract's imports, dependencies, and other key attributes, thereby enhancing debugging, auditing, and verification processes.\n\n## Modules Overview\n### Deployer\nThis core module of *Smart Contract Station* handles user interaction, checks the existence of folders and files, as well as retrieves syntax information about the contracts. It also creates necessary folders for deployment, determines the endpoint for deployment, and deploys the contracts.\n[Read More](deployer.md)\n\n### Contract Variables Manager\nThis script molds and prepares the components of smart contracts for deployment. It verifies resources, processes contract components, and handles the contract's data.\n[Read More](contract_variables_manager.md)\n\n### Flattener\nThe Flattener module simplifies the structure of the contract, importing, cloning, and installing the Solidity flattener. The Flattener script modifies a given file structure based on a JSON configuration file, thereby creating a new JSON configuration for every flattening process. \n[Read More](flattener.md)\n\n### Initial Variables Manager\nThis script focuses on parsing smart contract components and saving contract data, thereby automating the process of smart contract deployment. It gathers all vital variables and information and handles various types of variables. \n[Read More](get_initial_vars.md)\n\n### Pragma Variables Manager\nThis script handles the versioning of smart contracts for automated deployment. The Pragma Variables Manager processes all pragma versions, retrieves pragma version details, and ensures that every Smart Contract aligns with its respective range and order of deployment.\n[Read More](pragma_variables_manager.md)\n\n### SPDX Manager\nIt deals with the management of SPDX License Identifiers in smart contracts. This class fetches SPDX identifiers from contracts and compares these identifiers with a predefined list.\n[Read More](spdx_manager.md)\n\n## Installation\nFollow the instructions listed below to get this project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/username/repo.git\n\n# Move into the cloned repository\ncd repo\n\n# Install all dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Run the tool\npython main.py\n```\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions of all kinds including documentation improvements, bug fixes, new features, or spelling mistakes.
